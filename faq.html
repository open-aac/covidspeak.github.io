	<h3>What is Co-VidSpeak?</h3>
  <p>AAC in the Cloud is not an ASHA CEU-certified conference. However, we will provide a certificate of attendance to those who register, attend sessions, and fill out our post-session form.  With that certificate you can report your participation to whoever you'd like! You can use the certificate to <a href="http://www.asha.org/certification/fact_records.htm" target="_blank">report ASHA Certification Maintenance Hours</a>, or as professional development hours for other state or organizational tracking.</p>
  <p>We will also post the videos afterward, and provide a tool to easily generate certificates of attendance whether you watch the sessions live or afterward. Post-conference attendance hours will receive the same certificate, so feel free to watch the sessions on a schedule that works for you!</p>

	<h3>Who Can Use Co-VidSpeak?</h3>
	<p>Co-VidSpeak may have lots of potential uses, but for now we are focusing on supporting people who are in a non-verbal, medically-isolated situation. Friends and loved ones can join the conversation remotely from whatever device they have access to for two-way communication supported by touch or eye gestures.</p>

	<h3>Is Co-VidSpeak Free?</h3>
	<p>Yes. We are hosting a free instance of Co-VidSpeak to make it easier for those who need it to gain access. This free instance has limited access so that we can provide focused, scalable support with limited funding. The app is also open source so others are welcome to run their own instance as well.</p>

	<h3>Will Co-VidSpeak Work on My Device?</h3>
	<p>Probably! Co-VidSpeak is web-based and built on modern web standards, so as long as your web browser isn't too old it should be able to run Co-VidSpeak effectively. Not all features are available on all devices. We suggest Chrome for the best experience.</p>

	<h3>Why Can't Just Anyone Sign Up?</h3>
	<p>We are hosting a free video conferencing web site with a specific purpose. Video calling takes lots of expensive bandwidth, and since we're not harvesting your data for advertising or something, the expense comes down to donations. We are trying to be responsible with the limited funding we have, while still making Co-VidSpeak as accessible as possible. We just can't open the floodgates to anyone and everyone.</p>

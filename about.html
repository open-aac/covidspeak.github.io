	<h3>This is No Time to Be Alone</h3>
	<p>
		Co-VidSpeak was created from discussions by Bill Binko and
		Brian Whitmer. We realized during the Covid-19 pandemic that
		people on a breathing tube in the ICU are being physically 
		isolated from family, but that a video call wouldn't be enough
		to help the communicate.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have family members and friends
		who have been intubated in intensive care situations, and
		wanted to make sure anyone in a socially isolated situation
		could still have access to and communication with the 
		people who were important to them.

	<h3>Keeping Things Open</h3>
	<p>
		We wanted to move fast and make as much impact as we could.
		So Co-VidChat is open source. We are contributing time 
		and resources to host free accounts of Co-VidChat that can
		be used by hospitals, medical groups, or others who 
		are in an isolated situation during the Covid-19 pandemic.
		You are welcome to 
		<a href="https://github.com/open-aac/covidspeak" target='_blank'>look at the source code</a>
		and set up your own instance or contribute to the project.
	</p>
	<p>We have been working and collaborating with open source
		and open hardware communities for years. We believe in
		making a difference, and we hope Co-VidSpeak can help
		provide support to those who need it.
	</p>

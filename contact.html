  <p>
    Co-VidSpeak is available
    <a href="https://app.covidspeak.org/pricing">as a subscription service</a>,
    but we also work with sponsoring organizations to fund
    additional opportunities. Right now we are funding free
    accounts for any medical groups needing access during the 
    Covid-19 pandemic, with help from <a href="http://atmakers.org">ATMakers</a>.
    We are also actively looking for additional sponsors to expand
    the reach of our free initiative, so please contact us if you are interested!
  </p>
  <p>If you need help funding Co-VidSpeak, or are interested in learning more
    about our work, you can contact us directly, just
    <a href="https://forms.gle/3UQRcgYoPXYFpWWD9">fill out this Google Form</a> and we will get back to you as quickly as we can.</p>

  <p>Additionally, if you would like to support this project, please consider making a donation through ATMakers, or providing software development or speech therapy consulting support by joining us at openaac.org. We are always looking for smart, dedicated people to help grow this project into the future.</p>

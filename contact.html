  <p>Co-VidSpeak is not publicly accessible right now. We want to provide support to those who need it, but this is a free project and we can't affort to just open the floodgates. If you are in a situation where you can support implementing Co-VidSpeak to those who could use it, please reach out to us with your specific situation and how you can envision Co-VidSpeak helping.</p>

  <p>To contact us, <a href="https://forms.gle/3UQRcgYoPXYFpWWD9">please fill out this Google Form</a> and we will get back to you as quickly as we can.</p>

  <p>Additionally, if you would like to support this project, please consider making a donation through ATMakers, or providing software development or speech therapy consulting support by joining us at openaac.org.</p>
